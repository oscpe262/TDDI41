\subsection{1-2}
%a) What is an authoritative name server? What is its role in DNS.
a) A name server which answers queries about names in a zone.

%b) What is the difference between a domain and a zone.
b) A domain is a subtree of the namespace, and a zone is a part of the namespace of which a NS is authoritative. Zone $\subseteq$ Domain

%c) What is the difference between a recursive and a non-recursive query in DNS? When is each type of query used.
c) A recursive query will not return until it has a complete answer, whereas the non-recursive can return a "partial" answer---i.e. "I don't know, but ask this other guy ...".

Recursive resolving should foremost be used to focus the caching to specific machines rather than having entire subnets' hosts handle their own caching.

Iterative resolving is always found on authorative name servers.

%d) What is the purpose of delegation in DNS.
d) The purpose of delegation is to delegate administration of DNS zones, effectively limiting the branching factor for each NS.

%e) What is a resource record? What does a resource record consist of.
e) A RR consists of node name (NAME), record type (TYPE), class code (CLASS), TTL, length of the RDATA field (RDLENGTH), and data of type-specific relevance (RDATA) such as IP address and hostname.

%f) DNS messages contain answer, authority and additional sections. What is the purpose of each section.
f) "Answer" lists the answer to the query (Address record, Canonical name record).

"Authority" lists the authorities for the query.

"Additional" lists other relevant info related to the query, such as addresses of the name servers.

%g) How does the DNS protocol indicate if an answer comes from an authoritative name server or not? How does the DNS protocol indicate whether a query is recursive or not.
g) In the header:

  Authorative name server answer: $[$AA$]$\\
  Recursive query: $[$RD$]$

%h) Explain what glue records are and when they are necessary.
h) Glue records are A records, held higher in the tree, for delegated zone name servers.
