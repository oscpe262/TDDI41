%c) What is the difference between a recursive and a non-recursive query in DNS? When is each type of query used.

%d) What is the purpose of delegation in DNS.

%e) What is a resource record? What does a resource record consist of.

%f) DNS messages contain answer, authority and additional sections. What is the purpose of each section.
