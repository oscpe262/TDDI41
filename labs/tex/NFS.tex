\chapter{NFS}
\section{Exercise 1: Review and preparation}
\em Most of this documentation will not be available on marsix or on your systems (until you install the appropriate packages), but they are available on the Internet. The man pages for autofs are not very good, and autofs is notoriously finicky. Read the documentation carefully. If you miss a single word in the wrong place you can end up wasting huge amounts of time.\em

\subsection{1-1 Review the documentation for the Linux kernel NFS server.}

\subsection{1-2 Review the documentation for the Linux automounter (autofs).}

\subsection{1-3 What is an automount map.}

\subsection{1-4 What is the name of the main configuration file for autofs.}

\subsection{1-5 How can you refer to an automount map in NIS from the main configuration file.}

\subsection{1-6 How do you configure the system so it looks for the main configuration file in NIS instead of looking for a regular file.}

%Report: Nothing to report.

\section{Exercise 2: Configuration}
\subsection{2-1 Explain what the automounter is and how it works.}

\subsection{2-2 Explain what an automount map is, and the difference between direct and indirect maps.}

\subsection{2-3 What is the purpose of an automounter? Why not use static network mounts instead.}

%Report: Answers to the questions above.
