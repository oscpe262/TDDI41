# Lab Series TDDI41 HT16
Worth noting: this repo consists of two parts: the marsix (LiU course server) part and the local system part. The marsix part is pretty much everything apart from the playbooks.

The reason behind this is that marsix sucks ... The marsix part is complete for grade 3 (HT16) but for grade 4 and 5 a local system environment is needed.

The local system, for which this is tested, is an Arch Linux install with four Arch Linux VMs corresponding to the original lab environment, but with - of course - everything that differs an old crappy sysvinit-debian install from an up-to-date Arch Linux install with systemd ...
