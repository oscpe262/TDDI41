# TDDI41 - Introduction to System Administration

The full lab series can be found at [https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDI41/labs/index.en.shtml]. That said, this repo is for learning purposes only. I personally don't give a crap if you hand this stuff in, risk being suspended or what not. That is your problem, not mine. Keep in mind that this is a public repo, and since you could find it, so can your examiner.

However, I do mind if you've passed this course and don't know your shit if we happen to work together at some point. I do know that even for an experienced Linux user, stuff you can't control can make this lab series take way longer than expected to finish. Therefore, this is available.

Here, you will find:
- near complete lab reports (feel free to contribute where incomplete)
- complete idempotent bash scripts for all labs (decently annotated, feel free to improve and contribute) to cover grade 3
- ansible roles and cookbook (yet to be tested though) to set up everything apart from rudimentary parts of NET and SCT7 (SCT7 to be added at some point)

You will not find:
- ansible tests (TBA)
- grade 5 stuff, as I intended to be a guinea pig for the Kerberos lab, but never got around to it.

## Examiners
I've made all repos I used during my time at LiU available once the course was done that term. There has been a few occasions where those who run the course has contacted me asking for me to take down the repo or make it private. Just to save you the time of writing a mail to me about it, the answer is always 'no'. There has been one exception due to the nature of the course in question, but this course is not like that one.

Here is the thing ... You as an examiner have the obligation to ensure that each student has aquired the necessary skills/knowledge, and short technical answers to a set of questions that are the same each year does not ensure the proficiency of a student. It only ensures that someone has had the proficiency at one point. Of course, such a set of questions is a great tool for aiding learning, and it should be treated as such. The scripting part of the labs done here is fairly unique and my guess is that you'll rarely see it done this way (as it is major overkill to write a configuration management tool in bash when it won't render you a higher grade).

If someone uses my Ansible roles (be that from this or any of my other repos), it should be encouraged. The golden rules of a sysadmin are after all "don't do something twice" and "don't reinvent the wheel".
