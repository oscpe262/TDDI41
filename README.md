# TDDI41 - Introduction to System Administration

The full lab series can be found at [https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDI41/labs/index.en.shtml]. That said, this repo is for learning purposes only. I personally don't give a crap if you hand this stuff in, risk being suspended or what not. That is your problem, not mine.

However, I do mind if you've passed this course and don't know your shit if we happen to work together at some point. I do know that even for an experienced Linux user, stuff you can't control can make this lab series take way longer than expected to finish. Therefore, this is available.

Here, you will find:
- near complete lab reports (feel free to contribute where incomplete)
- complete idempotent bash scripts for all labs (decently annotated, feel free to improve and contribute) to cover grade 3
- ansible roles and cookbook (yet to be tested though) to set up everything apart from rudimentary parts of NET and SCT7 (SCT7 to be added at some point)

You will not find:
- ansible tests (TBA)
- grade 5 stuff, as I intended to be a guinea pig for the Kerberos lab, but never got around to it.
